# ------ KNN Classification Program ------
This is a program that uses the KNN Algorithm to classify new data based on previous labeled data.
It performs the Euclidean distance under the hood to find the distance of the data points.
This is an application where our model is executed and evaluated against a fake dataset.
The algorithms were developed from scratch. No libraries involved, nothing, nada :)
Note: The program was developed for learning purposes. It is not intended for production.
There are far better libraries out there that are better optimized like: scikit-learn, apache mllib, xgboost etc.
